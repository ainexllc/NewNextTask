# Vercel Deployment Guide for NextTaskPro

## ðŸš¨ Current Deployment Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Missing Environment Variables in Vercel

**Problem**: The `vercel.json` was trying to reference environment variables using `@` syntax but they weren't configured in Vercel dashboard.

**Solution**: You need to add these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add the following variables:

```bash
# Required Firebase Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDd-4nP6HlzNgxtpHaXqw6--hsez2Ln3Ds
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=newhomekeep.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=newhomekeep
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=newhomekeep.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=826483148928
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:826483148928:web:7f2db6c32070062f83be65

# Deployment URL (will be auto-set by Vercel)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

**For each variable:**
- Name: Use the exact name (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`)
- Value: Use the value from your `.env.local`
- Environment: Select "Production", "Preview", and "Development"

### Issue 2: Node.js Runtime Version

**Fixed**: Updated `vercel.json` to use Node.js 20.x (was 18.x) which is more stable for Firebase v12.

### Issue 3: Firebase Configuration Validation

**Fixed**: Added validation to catch missing environment variables early in the build process.

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
# Test local build
npm run build
npm run start

# Verify no errors in browser console
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
- [ ] Add all Firebase env vars to Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Verify environment names match exactly
- [ ] Test in all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### 3. Firebase Configuration
- [ ] Ensure Firebase project is active
- [ ] Verify Firestore rules allow public read/write for authenticated users
- [ ] Check Storage rules for file uploads

### 4. Build Configuration
- [ ] `vercel.json` is properly configured
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`
- [ ] No build warnings that could cause issues

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to the main branch on GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. Check deployment logs in Vercel dashboard
4. Test the deployed application

### Method 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Firebase Connection Errors
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Firebase project is active and accessible
- Ensure domain is added to Firebase Auth authorized domains

### Build Failures
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure no import paths are case-sensitive issues

### Runtime Errors
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Check Vercel function logs for server-side errors
- Verify Firebase Firestore rules allow your operations

## ðŸ“Š Post-Deployment Verification

### Test These Features:
- [ ] User authentication (sign up/sign in)
- [ ] Dashboard loads with proper theming
- [ ] Task management works
- [ ] Notes creation/editing
- [ ] Subscriptions tracking
- [ ] Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- [ ] All pages load correctly

### Performance Checks:
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] Firebase console shows connections
- [ ] No console errors in production

## ðŸ”„ Environment Variables Reference

Copy these exactly into your Vercel dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDd-4nP6HlzNgxtpHaXqw6--hsez2Ln3Ds
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=newhomekeep.firebaseapp.com  
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=newhomekeep
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=newhomekeep.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=826483148928
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:826483148928:web:7f2db6c32070062f83be65
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Monitor**: Check Vercel analytics and Firebase usage
2. **Optimize**: Review Core Web Vitals and performance
3. **Scale**: Monitor user growth and Firebase quotas
4. **Update**: Set up CI/CD workflow for future updates
